# TankGame
A tank game between two players via Processing's networking capabilities.
Requires the server and client to run simultaneously on the same network.
Both require all the files in this repository to run except for its counterpart, 
that being if it is the server, it does not need the client class, and vice versa.

Difference from main branch:
RMB fires missiles that teleports the user to location of missile detonation.
Bricks fall from both directions.
